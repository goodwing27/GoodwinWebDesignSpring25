        <p class="text-center">The mission of the FIFA World Cup is to bring people from all over the world together
            through the love of football. It aims to celebrate the talent of players everywhere, while inspiring future
            generations to play with passion and respect.</p>

                <h5 class="text-center">History</h5>
                <p class="text-center">The FIFA World Cup started in 1930 in Uruguay and has been held every four years
                    (except during World War II). It began as a small tournament, but has grown into the biggest
                    sporting event on the planet. Over the decades, legends like Pelé, Maradona, and Zidane have left
                    many marks on the game. The World Cup has helped popularize football globally and brought people
                    together in celebration many times.

                <h5 class="text-center">Community</h5>
                <p class="text-center">Football is more than just a sport because it creates a sense of community around
                    the world. Fans from different countries and ethnicities come together to support their national
                    teams and share in the excitement. The sport is being played everywhere. Whether it be a small
                    neighborhood park or a massive stadium. Youth leagues and local clubs help keep the love for the
                    game alive and connect people of all ages and cultures.</p>

                <h5 class="text-center">Future</h5>
                <p class="text-center">Football’s future is very exciting with young talents rising through the ranks
                    and changing the way the game is played. Advances in technology like VAR have helped make the sport
                    fairer and more accurate. More people and countries are investing in football, and women’s soccer is
                    growing faster than ever. The sport will continue to evolve and bring even more people together
                    around the world.</p>
