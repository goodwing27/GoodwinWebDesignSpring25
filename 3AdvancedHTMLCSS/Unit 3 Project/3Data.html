        <p> NFL coaches have a big role in the Super Bowl. They must make timely decisions, like which plays to run and how to use
            the time well. A good coach stays calm and can change the plan if the team is not doing well. Coaches like
            Bill Belichick and Andy Reid have won more than one Super Bowl by being smart and great leaders.
            <br>
            Coaches also help the team get ready for the big game. They watch a lot of film to learn about the other
            team. Then they make a plan that uses their own team's strong points and tries to beat the weak spots of the
            other team. A team that is ready has a much better shot to win, and that work starts with the coach. A good
            coach can lead and push the team to do their best.
