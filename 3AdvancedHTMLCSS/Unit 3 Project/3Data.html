        <strong class="subTitle">The Coaches Effect On A Teams's SB Bowl Odds:</strong>
        <p> NFL coaches have a big role in the Super Bowl. They must make timely decisions, like which plays to run and
            how to use
            the time well. A good coach stays calm and can change the plan if the team is not doing well. Coaches like
            Bill Belichick and Andy Reid have won more than one Super Bowl by being smart and great leaders.
            Coaches also help the team get ready for the big game. They watch a lot of film to learn about the other
            team. Then they make a plan that uses their own team's strong points and tries to beat the weak spots of the
            other team. A team that is ready has a much better shot to win, and that work starts with the coach. A good
            coach can lead and push the team to do their best.
        </p>
        <strong class="subTitle">The Stats Behind The Best NFL Head Coaches:</strong>
        <p>Having a great coach is especially shown to be important when you consider the fact that over
            <em><strong>32%</strong></em> of all Superbowls have been won by the same <em><strong>5</strong></em> Head
            Coaches. During the Superbowl Era, there have been a total over 535 Head Coaches hired meaning that the
            <em><strong>5</strong></em> Head Coaches have accounted for 32% of all Superbowls, while making up only
            <em><strong>.9%</strong></em> of all head coaches hired!
