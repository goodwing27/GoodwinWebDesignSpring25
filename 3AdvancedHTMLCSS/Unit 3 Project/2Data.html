        <p>The division of a team is very important for their chances of making the Super Bowl. Better divisions make it
            much harder to reach the playoffs, while weaker divisions give teams a better chance to win more games
            within their division. Teams in the same division play each other twice per regular season, so they know
            each otherâ€™s plays and style well. These tougher games help teams prepare for the playoffs, but too many
            divisional losses could keep them out of the playoffs all together.</p>
