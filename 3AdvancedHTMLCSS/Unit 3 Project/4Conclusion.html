        <p><strong class="subTitle">Key Findings/Insights:</strong>After observing the data, it is clear to see how
            difficult it can be to win without the proper head coach and an unlucky placement of the division. However,
            these metrics mostly are referring to short term success. It is easy to fire a bad coach, the challenge is
            finding a great one. One capable of winning on the biggest stage! As for the division, that is all luck, but
            it can change from season to season. In 2022, the NFC North was considered one of the worst divisions in
            football, 2024 one of the greatest of All-Time.</p>
        <p><strong class="subTitle">Implications Behind the Data:</strong>Over time, it is clear through the data
            collected that winning is not just about having the right head coach for one season. It is easy to fire a
            coach who isn’t working out, but finding the right one who can lead the team to success year after year is a
            much bigger challenge. A great coach must be able to handle the pressure and make the right decisions over
            time. Success is not about just one good season, it is about being consistent, but adaptable with your play
            style and coaching.</p>
        <p><strong class="subTitle">Reflection:</strong>The strength of a division can change significantly over time,
            impacting a team's path to success. For instance, the AFC South, once considered one of the NFL's weaker
            divisions, has become more competitive. In 2023, the Houston Texans clinched the division title with a 10–7
            record, and they repeated as champions in 2024 . This shift highlights how divisional strength can evolve,
            influencing a team's playoff prospects and overall performance.</p>
