    <div class="content"><h2>A pilot falls in the sciences of aeronautics and physics</h2>
    <p>Being a pilot involves flying airplanes from airport to airport. It allows you to travel while
        getting paid! Though you may be "at work" for several days at a timer only a part of that is
        spent working. It allows for a very flexible schedule and has great pay!</p></div>
