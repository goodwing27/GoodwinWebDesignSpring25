        <h2><em>Introduction to Penguins</em><strong></strong></h2>
        <p>  Penguins are my <i>favorite</i> animals because they are birds that cannot fly. There
            are <strong>18</strong> different species of penguins located across the coldest regions
            of the southern hemisphere<!--(Except for Galapagos Penguins)-->! Penguins are colored
            black and white to camouflage themselves when are predators in the water such as orcas
            and sharks. The most common include Emperor, King, Macaroni, and Chinstrap.

        <h2><strong><em>What Do Penguins Eat?</em></strong></h2>
        <p>Penguins mainly eat <strong>fish, squid, and krill</strong>. Between these three it mostly depends on
            their <strong>species</strong> and <strong>habitat</strong>. They catch their food on
            daily dives into the freezing water. Though they are flightless birds, their wings/flippers do
            serve a very important purpose. That purpose is to help them swim effectively through
            the water. It is important to remember that penguins are strictly carnivorous birds and
            don't ever consume plants.</p>

        <h2><strong><em>Breeding</em></strong></h2>
        <p>In order to reproduce, penguins find a new mate each season. They attract their mates by
            exchanging <strong>pebbles</strong> as a gift! This is a special gift to penguins because they often use
            pebbles to construct a nest. Essentially, this action tells the penguin they want a
            family! Once they have eggs they must protect and keep them warm. That's why the father
            penguin stands on them in the snow. Once hatched, <strong>both parents</strong> work together in raising
            their baby penguins for a year. Then it is their turn! </p>
