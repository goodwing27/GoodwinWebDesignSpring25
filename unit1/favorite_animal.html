        <h2><em>Introduction to Penguins</em><strong></strong></h2>
        <p> Penguins are my <i>favorite</i> animals because they are birds that cannot fly. There
            are <strong>18</strong> different species of penguins located across the coldest regions
            of the southern hemisphere<!--(Except for Galapagos Penguins)-->! Penguins are colored
            black and white to camouflage themselves from aquatic predators in the water such as
            orcas and sharks. The most common types of penguins include emperor, king, macaroni, and
            chinstrap. </p>

        <h2><strong><em>What Do Penguins Eat?</em></strong></h2>
        <p> A penguins diet mainly consists of:<strong><br>1. Fish<br>2. Squid<br>3. Krill</strong>
        <br>Between these three food sources it mostly depends on their <strong>species</strong>
            and <strong>habitat</strong>. They catch their food on daily dives into the freezing water.
            Though they are flightless birds, their wings/flippers do serve a very important purpose.
            They often come in handy when escaping predators. Due to overfishing, penguins are being
            challenged more than ever to swim further in the dangerous waters for food. It is <em>
            important</em> to remember that penguins are strictly carnivorous birds and don't ever
            consume plants so they <strong>MUST</strong> go on these dangerous dives for survival!</p>

        <h2><strong><em>Breeding</em></strong></h2>
        <p> In order to reproduce, penguins find a new mate each season. They attract their mates
            by exchanging <strong>pebbles</strong> as a gift! This is a special gift to penguins
            because they often use pebbles to construct a nest. Essentially, this action tells the
            penguin they want a family! Since penguins only lay <strong>1-2</strong> eggs per mating
            season, they must protect the eggs from land predators and keep them safe from the
            elements.  That's why the father penguin stands on them in the snow. After enough eggs
            are laid a new colony is created. These penguins will spend much of the next year
            together. Once hatched, <strong>both parents</strong> work together in raising their
            baby penguins for a year. Then it is their turn! </p>
