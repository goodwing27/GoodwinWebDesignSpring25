        <h1><strong>Favorite Hobby</strong></h1>
        <hr>
        <h2 style="background-color:#03f0ec;"><strong><em> Overview and Background</em></strong></h2>
        <p>I started my YouTube channel in April of 2021, fresh out of the oandemic. I originally
            created it under the username "Super Random Shorts" and that name last for 3 years. Before
            last year the growth on my channel was minimal because I was never consistent to posting new
            and creative videos. last winter that all changed when I totally switched up my video style
            and niche for which I was posting videos. This led to rapid growth where I gained over
            18,000 subscribers in just a 2 1/2 month span. I wanted to change the name to better show
            what I was posting that is why I switched the name to "Outer Eight". After going on a
            consistent posting spree I began to feel burnt out. I decided to stop posting for a little
            over a month, but instead focus on one long video, so that I could be more flexible with
            my time. After that video released in June I took the summer to prepare for making
            consistent full-length videos in the fall. this was when I created my predictions serious.
            I made 18 templates, so I could post one video for every single game of the NFL season.
            Later on, in November my shorts content picked up and I gained  6K more subscribers. Right
            now, I Have a 32 video long series going where I rank NFL teams based on who I'd want to see
            win the Super next year.</p>

        <h2 style="background-color:#03f0ec;"><em><strong>My Favorite Videos that I have made...</em></strong></h2>
        <p>Though I enjoy amking short form content, I find that the most fulfilling videos to create
            are full-length videos. It is easier to have a storyline rather than just a quick snippet
            of information. The absolute favorite video I created took me over two months from start to
            finish. It involved mailing every MLB team a letter that asked for a types of free stuff
            they had. The reponses I got back were awesome! Even just the smallest letter made my day
            every time I got a response. In total over 12 teams sent me stuff and my 2 favorite teams,
            the Detroit Tigers and Baltimore Orioles sent me the most gear. These types of videos take
            the longest, but are the most rewarding and I will never forget the memories I gained from
            them.</p>

        <h2 style="background-color:#03f0ec;"><em><strong>How Other Youtube Channels Compare to Mine</em></strong></h2>
        <p>Since I began posting I always had a goal in mind. As I haev reached those goals my
            ambition gets larger and larger. With these milestones comes competition. The niche where 
            I make content i full of skilled editors. If I have learned anything through my experience 
            making videos it is that  the more professional looking the better it will be recieved. This 
            is the key reason I think the best way to grow is through dedicated work. </p>
